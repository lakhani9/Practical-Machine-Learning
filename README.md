Practical Machine Learning - project

Background
Using devices such as JawboneUp, NikeFuelBand, and Fitbitit is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity
relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements
about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that 
people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked 
to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website (see the section
on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

Data
The training data for this project are available here. The test data are available here.

Project's rubric
The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the classe variable in the training set. Use 
any of the other variables to predict with.

Create a report describing how to build the model, how to use cross validation, what the expected out of sample error is, and why make
the choices. Then use the prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

Model Approach used in project
The project explore Random Forest, Forest of Trees and GBM models and picks the best model to predict 'classe' - which predicts the manner 
in which they did the exercise
